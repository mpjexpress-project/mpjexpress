Introduction
============

MPJ Express is a reference implementation of the mpiJava 1.2 API, which
is an MPI-like API for Java defined by the Java Grande forum. 

MPJ Express can be configured in three ways: 

1. Multicore Configuration: This configuration is used by developers who want 
   to execute their parallel Java applications on multicore or shared 
   memory machines (laptops and desktops).

2. Cluster Configuration: This configuration is used by developers who want to 
   execute their parallel Java applications on distributed memory platforms
   including clusters and network of computers. 

3. Hybrid Configuration: This configuration is used by developers who want to 
   execute their parallel Java application on cluster of multicore machines i.e.
   nodes in clusters having multicore machines and are connected throught some
   high speed interconnect.

This document contains steps to help you execute your first MPJ Express program
on UNIX/Linux/Mac platforms. Windows users should consult README-win.txt.

Pre-requisites
==============

1. Java 1.6 (stable) or higher
2. Apache ant 1.6.2 or higher (Optional)
3. Perl (Optional) 

Running MPJ Express Programs in the Multicore Configuration
===========================================================

1. Download MPJ Express and unpack it. 
2. Set MPJ_HOME and PATH environmental variables:
       export MPJ_HOME=/path/to/mpj/
       export PATH=$PATH:$MPJ_HOME/bin 
       (These above two lines can be added to ~/.bashrc)
3. Write your MPJ Express program (HelloWorld.java) and save it. 
4. Compile: javac -cp .:$MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar HelloWorld.java
5. Execute: mpjrun.sh -np 4 HelloWorld

Running MPJ Express Programs in the Cluster Configuration
=========================================================

1. Download MPJ Express and unpack it. 
2. Set MPJ_HOME and PATH environmental variables:
       export MPJ_HOME=/path/to/mpj/
       export PATH=$PATH:$MPJ_HOME/bin 
       (These above two lines can be added to ~/.bashrc)
3. Write your MPJ Express program (HelloWorld.java) and save it. 
4. Write a machines file (name it "machines") stating host names or IP
   addresses of all machines involved in the parallel execution.
5. Start daemons: mpjboot machines
6. Compile: javac -cp .:$MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar HelloWorld.java
7. Execute: mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev niodev HelloWorld
8. Stop daemons: mpjhalt machines  


Running MPJ Express Programs in the Hybrid Configuration
=========================================================

1. Download MPJ Express and unpack it.
2. Set MPJ_HOME and PATH environmental variables:
       export MPJ_HOME=/path/to/mpj/
       export PATH=$PATH:$MPJ_HOME/bin
       (These above two lines can be added to ~/.bashrc)
3. Write your MPJ Express program (HelloWorld.java) and save it.
4. Write a machines file (name it "machines") stating host names or IP
   addresses of all machines involved in the parallel execution.
5. Start daemons: mpjboot machines
6. Compile: javac -cp .:$MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar HelloWorld.java
7. Execute: mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev hybdev HelloWorld
8. Stop daemons: mpjhalt machines


Known Issues
============

1. One of the known issues of MPJ Express in cluster configuration is incorrect working 
   directroy. This issue is reported on cluster build using Rocks clusters. MPJRun module
   of MPJ Express reads the current directory i.e. user directory using System.getProperty("user.dir")
   It should retrun same path as Unix 'pwd' command. But it is not giving same result. As a manual work 
   around for this issue is to use -wdir switch in mpjrun command and giving path to the current directory 
   where HelloWorld is placed i.e.
           mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev niodev -wdir /export/home/aamir/projects/mpj-user/ HelloWorld
