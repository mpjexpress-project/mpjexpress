Introduction
============

MPJ Express is a reference implementation of the mpiJava 1.2 API, which
is an MPI-like API for Java defined by the Java Grande forum. 

MPJ Express can be configured in two ways: 

1. Multicore Configuration: This configuration is used by developers who want 
   to execute their parallel Java applications on multicore or shared 
   memory machines (laptops and desktops).

2. Cluster Configuration: This configuration is used by developers who want to 
   execute their parallel Java applications on distributed memory platforms
   including clusters and network of computers. There are four options in the 
   cluster configuration.
   
   i) niodev - uses Java NIO Sockets
   ii) mxdev - uses Myrinet eXpress (MX) library for Myrinet networks
   iii) hybdev - for clusters of multicore processors
   iv) native - uses a native MPI library (like MPICH, MVAPICH, Open MPI) 

This document contains steps to help you execute your first MPJ Express program
on UNIX/Linux/Mac platforms. Windows users should consult README-win.txt.

Pre-requisites
==============

1. Java 1.6 (stable) or higher (Mandatory)
2. Apache ant 1.6.2 or higher (Optional)
3. Perl (Optional)
4. Native MPI library (Optional): Native MPI library such as MPICH, MVAPICH
   or Open MPI is required for running MPJ Express in cluster configuration
   with native device.
5. CMake (Optional): CMake is used for generating Makefile to compile native 
   JNI C code

Running MPJ Express Programs in the Multicore Configuration
===========================================================

1. Download MPJ Express and unpack it. 
2. Set MPJ_HOME and PATH environmental variables:
       export MPJ_HOME=/path/to/mpj/
       export PATH=$MPJ_HOME/bin:$PATH 
       (These above two lines can be added to ~/.bashrc)
3. Write your MPJ Express program (HelloWorld.java) and save it. 
4. Compile: javac -cp .:$MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar HelloWorld.java
5. Execute: mpjrun.sh -np 4 HelloWorld

Running MPJ Express Programs in the Cluster Configuration
=========================================================

1. Assuming you have completed step 1 to 4 of the Multicore Configuration.
2. Write a machines file (name it "machines") stating host names or IP
   addresses of all machines involved in the parallel execution.
3. Execution:
-- For niodev, hybdev and mxdev
     i) Start daemons: mpjboot machines
    ii) Execute: mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev niodev HelloWorld
          -- For -dev <device> here device can be niodev, hybdev or mxdev
   iii) Stop daemons: mpjhalt machines
-- For native device
     i) Compile JNI wrapper library:
        a) Make sure a native MPI library is installed on the 
           system and working. MVAPICH can be downloaded from 
	   http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu and installed.
           Make sure that the native MPI library is working 
           before moving to the next step.
        b) Change directory to native code as follows: 
           cd $MPJ_HOME/src/mpjdev/natmpjdev/lib;
        c) Run make: make - this will generate libnativempjdev.so file.
        d) Install: make install - this will copy the libnativempjdev.so 
           to the $MPJ_HOME/lib directory.
    ii) Execute the Hello World MPJ code: 
        a) $MPILIB/bin/mpirun_rsh -export-all -np 2 gpu05 gpu06 MV2_CPU_BINDING_LEVEL=SOCKET MV2_CPU_BINDING_POLICY=SCATTER java -cp $MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar:. -Djava.library.path=$MPJ_HOME/lib HelloWorld 0 0 native
        b) mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev native HelloWorld (not working)

Running MPJ Express Programs on Apache Hadoop Clusters
=========================================================
To run your MPJ programs on Apache Hadoop Clusters, please refer to "yarnguide.pdf"
in $MPJ_HOME/doc folder

Known Issues
============

1. One of the known issues of MPJ Express in cluster configuration is incorrect 
   working directroy. This issue is reported on cluster build using Rocks 
   clusters. MPJRun module of MPJ Express reads the current directory i.e. user
   directory using System.getProperty("user.dir") It should retrun same path as 
   Unix 'pwd' command. But it is not giving same result. As a manual work 
   around for this issue is to use -wdir switch in mpjrun command and giving 
   path to the current directory where HelloWorld is placed i.e.
        mpjrun.sh -np 4 -dev niodev -wdir /export/home/aamir/projects/mpj-user/ HelloWorld
